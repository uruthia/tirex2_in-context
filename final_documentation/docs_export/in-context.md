# In-context forecasting

TiRex-2 forecasts zero-shot: everything it knows about a series comes from the context you
pass in. This guide uses a real hydraulic test rig to show how the *amount* of context, and a
related sensor passed as a covariate, change the forecast. The whole guide uses one pair of
cycles: cycle **1787** is the context, cycle **1788** is the ground truth to forecast.

???+ info "Key terms"
    | Term | Meaning |
    | :--- | :------ |
    | **Cycle** | One 60 s run of the rig's load profile, stored as 200 points (0.3 s resolution). |
    | **PS1 / EPS1** | PS1 = pressure sensor (bar). EPS1 = motor power (W). |
    | **Context** | The history given to the model. Here: cycle 1787, optionally repeated *n* times back to back. |
    | **Forecast horizon** | What the model predicts: the next full cycle (200 points = 60 s), compared with the real cycle 1788. |
    | **10–90 % band** | The range between the 0.1 and 0.9 quantile forecasts. The model expects the truth to fall inside it 80 % of the time. |
    | **Covariate** | An extra series (here EPS1) given alongside the target (PS1) as additional context. |
    | **MAE** | Mean absolute error, `mean(|forecast - truth|)`, in bar. Lower is better. |

## The data

The data comes from the UCI
[Condition monitoring of hydraulic systems](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/447/condition+monitoring+of+hydraulic+systems)
dataset. We use two of its sensors, PS1 (pressure) and EPS1 (motor power), and two consecutive
cycles in which the rig is healthy and stable: **1787** and **1788**. Each cycle is
block-averaged to 200 points. In the code below, `ps1[1787]` is the PS1 signal of cycle 1787,
an array of shape `(200,)`, and the same holds for `eps1`.

        loading="lazy" style="width:100%; height:660px; border:0;"></iframe>

Every cycle runs the same fixed load profile, so the two cycles are almost identical. PS1 and
EPS1 live on very different scales, but they move together.

## Forecasting the next cycle

We give TiRex-2 cycle 1787 as context, optionally repeated *n* times, and ask for the next 200
points:

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
from tirex2 import TimeseriesType, load_model

model = load_model("NX-AI/TiRex-2", device="cpu")  # or device="cuda"

n = 1                                       # number of repeated cycles in the context
context = np.tile(ps1[1787], n)             # (n * 200,)

ts = TimeseriesType(
    target=torch.tensor(context, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0),  # (1, context_length)
    past_covariates=None,
    future_covariates=None,
)

forecast = model.forecast([ts], prediction_length=200, output_type="numpy")[0]
# forecast.shape == (1, 9, 200)  -> (num_target_variates, num_quantiles, prediction_length)

median, p10, p90 = forecast[0, 4], forecast[0, 0], forecast[0, 8]
mae = np.mean(np.abs(median - ps1[1788]))   # error against the real next cycle, in bar
```

The 9 quantiles are the levels `0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9`. We plot the median (index `4`) as the
point forecast and use the `0.1` and `0.9` quantiles (indices `0` and `8`) as the band. We
score the median against the real cycle 1788 with the MAE.

## One cycle of context

With a single cycle of context, TiRex-2 has seen the shape only once:

<iframe src="../../assets/in-context/forecast-one-cycle.html" title="PS1 forecast from one cycle of context"
        loading="lazy" style="width:100%; height:600px; border:0;"></iframe>

The forecast is flat and cautious, with a wide band (MAE = 11.02 bar). From one cycle alone,
the model cannot tell that the pattern will repeat.

## More context: repeating the cycle

Now we keep the same target, but repeat cycle 1787 *n* = 1 … 5 times
(`np.tile(ps1[1787], n)`). This adds **no new information** about the process. It only shows
the model that the signal is periodic, and how stable it is. Move the slider, or press play,
to see the forecast change with *n*:

        loading="lazy" style="width:100%; height:600px; border:0;"></iframe>

The MAE for each context length:

<iframe src="../../assets/in-context/error-vs-context.html" title="Forecast error vs. context length"
        loading="lazy" style="width:100%; height:520px; border:0;"></iframe>

The MAE drops from 11.02 bar (1 cycle) to 5.58, 2.45, 1.64 and 1.29 bar (5 cycles). Most of
the gain comes in the first 3–4 cycles.

## Adding a covariate

TiRex-2 can also use other series while forecasting the target. Here we pass EPS1 of cycle 1787
as a past covariate. It is repeated like PS1, because `past_covariates` must have the same
length as the target context (see [Covariates](covariates.md)):

```python
ts = TimeseriesType(
    target=torch.tensor(np.tile(ps1[1787], n), dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0),           # (1, context_length)
    past_covariates=torch.tensor(np.tile(eps1[1787], n), dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0),  # (1, context_length)
    future_covariates=None,
)

forecast = model.forecast([ts], prediction_length=200, output_type="numpy")[0]
# forecast.shape == (1, 9, 200)  -> only the target is forecast, not the covariate
```

The green forecast uses PS1 **and** EPS1, the red one uses PS1 only. The lower panel shows the
extra signal the model sees:

        loading="lazy" style="width:100%; height:800px; border:0;"></iframe>

The two errors side by side:

        loading="lazy" style="width:100%; height:520px; border:0;"></iframe>

MAE in bar of the forecast of cycle 1788 (lower is better):

| MAE (bar) | 1 cycle | 2 cycles | 3 cycles | 4 cycles | 5 cycles |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| univariate | 11.02 | 5.58 | 2.45 | 1.64 | 1.29 |
| +EPS1 covariate | 11.01 | 3.26 | 1.99 | 1.43 | 1.23 |
| covariate gain | 0 % | 42 % | 19 % | 13 % | 5 % |

## Takeaways

- **One cycle is not enough to recognise the pattern.** The forecast stays flat and cautious
  (MAE ≈ 11.0 bar).
- **Repeating the context is the cheapest improvement.** Going from 1 to 5 cycles lowers the
  error by about 88 %, without adding any new information.
- **A covariate helps most when the context is short.** With 2 cycles, EPS1 cuts the error by
  42 %. The gain shrinks to 5 % at 5 cycles, once the target's own history is enough.
- **In practice:** if you only have 2–3 cycles of history, add related sensors as covariates.

!!! note "Scope"
    These results come from a single context/target pair (1787 → 1788) of one healthy
    operating condition. Read them as one example, not as a statistical result.
